Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
Example Input :
56
Example Output:
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
# Get the current age from the user
current_age = int(input("Enter your current age: "))

# Constants
average_life_expectancy = 90
days_in_year = 365
weeks_in_year = 52
months_in_year = 12

# Calculate remaining time until 90 years old
remaining_years = average_life_expectancy - current_age
remaining_days = remaining_years * days_in_year
remaining_weeks = remaining_years * weeks_in_year
remaining_months = remaining_years * months_in_year

# Display the results
print(f"You have approximately:")
print(f"You have {remaining_days} days, {remaining_weeks} weeks, and {remaining_months} months left.")
