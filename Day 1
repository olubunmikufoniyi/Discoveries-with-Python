Create a variable called "number" and assign any integer value to it.
Use an if-else statement to check if the number is even or odd. You can use the modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder of a division operation, to check if the number is divisible by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even, otherwise it is odd.
You can also use logical operator "and" to check if the number is divisible by 2 and greater than 10.
You can use logical operator "or" to check if the number is either divisible by 2 or greater than 10.

# Assign any integer value to the variable "number"
number = 15

# Check if the number is even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is even.")
elif number > 10:
    print(f"{number} is odd and greater than 10.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is odd and not greater than 10.")
