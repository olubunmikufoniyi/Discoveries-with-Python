Instruction
You will be building a program that generates a band name based on the city you grew up in and the name of your pet.
To complete the project, you will need to use skills such as printing inputs, variables, new lines, string manipulation, and debugging.
Example Output:

Create a greeting for your program.
Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
Ask the user for the name of a pet.
Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line

Lets build this in different ways

First method
# Greeting
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")

# Ask for the city and pet names
city_name = input("What city did you grow up in? ")
pet_name = input("What is the name of your pet? ")

# Combine the city and pet names to create the band name
band_name = city_name + " " + pet_name

# Display the band name
print(f"Your band name could be: {band_name}")
 

Second Method
This version uses an f-string to combine the city and pet names, and it presents the final band name in a slightly different way. The functionality remains the same, and you can choose the version that you find more readable or preferable.

def generate_band_name():
    print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")
    
    city_name = input("Enter the city where you grew up: ")
    pet_name = input("Enter the name of your pet: ")

    band_name = city_name + " " + pet_name

    print("Your band name could be:", band_name)

# Call the function to generate the band name
generate_band_name()

Third Method
In this version, the Band Name Generator logic is encapsulated within a function named generate_band_name(). This can be useful if you want to reuse the functionality elsewhere in your code or if you prefer organizing your code into functions for better readability.

def generate_band_name(city, pet):
    return f"Your band name could be: {city} {pet}"

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")

    city_name = input("Enter the city where you grew up: ")
    pet_name = input("Enter the name of your pet: ")

    band_name = generate_band_name(city_name, pet_name)

    print(band_name)
